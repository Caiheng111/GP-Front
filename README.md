## R1 - Description of your website  

**Purpose and Target Audience**  
The website is for a general practice clinic in Malaysia called Klinik Dr Leong Subang Jaya (Dr Leong's medical clinic). It is a fairly new medical clinic opened in early 2019 that does not have a website up and running yet. Currently, the clinic uses a Facebook page to provide information such as opening hours and contact information for patients.  

The website is intended to be used to replace the clinic's Facebook page as the main source of information about the clinic. It is intended to be used by both clinic staff and patients.  

For patients and unregistered users, the site can be used to view information about the clinic including the staff information, opening hours and contact information, as well as send a general email enquiry.  Patients registered with an account an make an appointment by completing a form. They will have access to a user dashboard where they can update their information and view and modify appointments.
